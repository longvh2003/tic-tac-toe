  "Self-confidence is a tricky subject for many people. For some, it's impossible to feel good about themselves without outside validation. When you're in a situation where the people in your life aren't helping you to feel better about yourself, this can become a problem in your day to day life.

  "Two members of the 1984 class of Jefferson High School are chairing a group of 18 to look for a resort for the 20-year class reunion. A lovely place 78 miles from the city turns out to be the best. It has 254 rooms and a banquet hall to seat 378. It has been open 365 days per year since opening on May 30, 1926. They will need 450 to reserve the resort. Debbie Holmes was put in charge of buying 2,847 office machines for the entire firm. Debbie visited more than 109 companies in 35 states in 6 months. She will report to the board today in Room 2784 at 5 p.m. The board will consider her report about those 109 firms and recommend the top 2 or 3 brands to purchase. Debbie must decide before August 16. Lynn Greene said work started on the project March 27, 2003. The 246 blueprints were mailed to the office 18 days ago. The prints had to be 100 percent accurate before they were acceptable. The project should be finished by May 31, 2025. At that time there will be 47 new condominiums, each having at least 16 rooms. The building will be 25 stories.",
  "The fastest typing speed ever, 216 words per minute, was achieved by Stella Pajunas-Garnand from Chicago in 1946 in one minute on an IBM electric. As of 2005, writer Barbara Blackburn was the fastest English language typist in the world, according to The Guinness Book of World Records. Using the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard, she had maintained 150 wpm for 50 minutes, and 170 wpm for shorter periods, with a peak speed of 212 wpm. Blackburn, who failed her QWERTY typing class in high school, first encountered the Dvorak keyboard in 1938, quickly learned to achieve very high speeds, and occasionally toured giving speed-typing demonstrations during her secretarial career. She appeared on Late Night with David Letterman on January 24, 1985, but felt that Letterman made a spectacle of her. Blackburn died in April 2008.",
  "When we talk about motivating others, the justification is the end result either we want to avoid the pain or go towards pleasure or what we want to get the person to do. How we achieve the end result, are our alternatives. As a manager, we need to understand the other person's justification and then come up with alternatives. We may then choose the right alternative. However, in general, we choose the first or the emotionally satisfying one. Typically people stop at this level of analysis and start to act. But a good manager would think of the following also: Will the action guarantee the consequence? What about other unintended consequences? This requires a certain experience. Are we capable of doing this action? Intention and the selection of the most ideal alternative do not guarantee execution, if we do not have the skills and the experience. Most motivational tactics fail, because without execution capability, they is only wishful thinking.",
  "There are many idiosyncratic typing styles in between novice-style hunt and peck and touch typing. For example, many hunt and peck typists have the keyboard layout memorized and are able to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. Some use just two fingers, while others use 3-6 fingers. Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers.",
